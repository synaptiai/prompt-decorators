# prompt_decorators

The `prompt_decorators` package is the core package for the Prompt Decorators framework.

## Overview

- **Core Modules**: Provide the fundamental functionality for defining, registering, and applying decorators.
- **Schema Modules**: Define the data structures and validation rules for decorators.
- **Utility Modules**: Provide helper functions and tools for working with decorators.
- **Integration Modules**: Provide integrations with various LLM platforms and tools.

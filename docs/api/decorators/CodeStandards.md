## Examples

### Applying JavaScript standards to React code

```
+++CodeStandards(standard=language-specific, strictness=required, focus=all)
Apply JavaScript best practices to this React component following Airbnb style guide.
```

The model will apply JavaScript-specific best practices to the React component, following required standards across all focus areas.

### Focusing on security standards

```
+++CodeStandards(standard=industry, strictness=strict, focus=security)
Review this Node.js API endpoint for security issues.
```

The model will strictly apply industry security standards to the Node.js API endpoint code.

### Using company standards for formatting

```
+++CodeStandards(standard=company, focus=formatting)

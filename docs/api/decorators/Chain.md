# Chain Decorator

A meta-decorator that applies multiple decorators in sequence, with each decorator processing the output of the previous one. This enables complex transformations by combining multiple simpler decorators in a pipeline.

**Category**: Meta

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `decorators` | `array` | Ordered list of decorators to apply in sequence | `Required` |
| `showSteps` | `boolean` | Whether to show intermediate outputs after each decorator in the chain | `False` |
| `stopOnFailure` | `boolean` | Whether to stop the chain if a decorator fails to apply correctly | `True` |

## Examples

### Basic sequential application of decorators

```
+++Chain(decorators=[StepByStep,Concise])
Explain how neural networks learn.
```

First generates a step-by-step explanation of neural network learning, then applies conciseness to that output

### Complex decorator chain with visible intermediate steps

```
+++Chain(decorators=[Socratic,Academic,TreeOfThought], showSteps=true, stopOnFailure=false)
Discuss the ethics of autonomous weapons.
```

Shows the progression of applying Socratic questioning, then academic tone, then tree-of-thought reasoning to discuss autonomous weapons ethics

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4o

**Instruction:** Apply these decorators in sequence: {decorators}. Each decorator processes the output of the previous one. {showSteps} {stopOnFailure}

**Notes:** This model handles decorator chains well, but benefits from clear instructions about showing steps or handling failures

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Process this request through a series of steps. For each step, apply one of these decorators in this exact order: {decorators}. Make sure to follow the exact order and treat each output as input to the next decorator. {showSteps} {stopOnFailure}

**Notes:** This model may need more explicit instructions to maintain the correct sequence of decorators


## Implementation Guidance

### Sequential application of step-by-step and concise decorators

**Original Prompt:**
```
Explain how neural networks learn.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please process this request through a series of transformations, applying each decorator in sequence. Apply the following decorators in this exact order: StepByStep, Concise. Each decorator should process the output of the previous one. Only show the final output after all decorators have been applied. If any decorator in the chain cannot be applied correctly, stop the processing and explain the issue.

Explain how neural networks learn.
```

### Complex decorator chain with visible intermediate steps

**Original Prompt:**
```
Discuss the ethics of autonomous weapons.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please process this request through a series of transformations, applying each decorator in sequence. Apply the following decorators in this exact order: Socratic, Academic, TreeOfThought. Each decorator should process the output of the previous one. Show the intermediate outputs after each decorator in the chain, clearly labeling each step. Continue processing even if some decorators cannot be fully applied, making best efforts for each step.

## Transformation Details

**Base Instruction:** Please process this request through a series of transformations, applying each decorator in sequence.

**Placement:** prepend

**Composition Behavior:** override

**Parameter Effects:**

- `decorators`:
  - Format: Apply the following decorators in this exact order: {value}. Each decorator should process the output of the previous one.

- `showSteps`:
  - When set to `true`: Show the intermediate outputs after each decorator in the chain, clearly labeling each step.
  - When set to `false`: Only show the final output after all decorators have been applied.

- `stopOnFailure`:
  - When set to `true`: If any decorator in the chain cannot be applied correctly, stop the processing and explain the issue.
  - When set to `false`: Continue processing even if some decorators cannot be fully applied, making best efforts for each step.

## Related Decorators

- **All**: Enhances Chain Chain can work with any decorators, as it's designed to combine them in sequence
- **Priority**: Conflicts with Chain Priority and Chain represent different approaches to handling multiple decorators (parallel vs. sequential)

# Comparison Decorator

Structures the response as a direct comparison between multiple items, concepts, or approaches. This decorator is ideal for highlighting similarities and differences across specific dimensions or criteria.

**Category**: Structure

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `aspects` | `array` | Specific aspects or dimensions to compare | `` |
| `format` | `enum` | The presentation format for the comparison | `table` |
| `highlight` | `boolean` | Whether to explicitly emphasize key differences | `True` |

## Format Options

- `table`: Present the comparison in a tabular format with items as columns (or rows) and comparison aspects as rows (or columns).
- `prose`: Present the comparison as flowing paragraphs that discuss each aspect across all items in a narrative style.
- `bullets`: Present the comparison as bulleted lists grouped by aspect or by item.

## Examples

### Basic tabular comparison of specific aspects

```
+++Comparison(aspects=[performance,cost,ease of use,ecosystem])
Compare React, Angular, and Vue for front-end development.
```

Creates a table comparing React, Angular, and Vue across the specified aspects, with key differences highlighted

### Prose-based comparison without specific aspects

```
+++Comparison(format=prose, highlight=false)
Compare democracy and authoritarianism as political systems.
```

Delivers a flowing prose comparison between democracy and authoritarianism, covering key differences and similarities in paragraph form

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Create a direct comparison between the items/concepts mentioned in the question. Use {format} format and compare them along {aspects} dimensions. {highlight}

**Notes:** This model sometimes needs more explicit structure for complex multi-dimensional comparisons


## Implementation Guidance

### Comparing programming frameworks with specific aspects

**Original Prompt:**
```
Compare React, Angular, and Vue for front-end development.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please structure your response as a direct comparison between multiple items, concepts, or approaches, highlighting their similarities and differences. Compare the items specifically across these aspects or dimensions: performance, cost, ease of use, ecosystem. Present the comparison in a tabular format with items as columns (or rows) and comparison aspects as rows (or columns). Explicitly emphasize or call attention to key differences between the items being compared.

### Prose comparison of political systems

**Original Prompt:**
```
Compare democracy and authoritarianism as political systems.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please structure your response as a direct comparison between multiple items, concepts, or approaches, highlighting their similarities and differences. Present the comparison as flowing paragraphs that discuss each aspect across all items in a narrative style. Present differences and similarities without special emphasis on either.

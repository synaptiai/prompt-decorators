## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `metrics` | `array` | Specific quality metrics to measure (e.g., accuracy, completeness, clarity, usefulness) | `` |
| `scale` | `enum` | Rating scale to use for evaluations | `1-5` |
| `explanation` | `boolean` | Whether to provide detailed explanations for each metric score | `True` |

## Scale Options

- `1-5`: Use a 1-5 scale for your ratings, where 1 represents the lowest quality and 5 represents the highest quality.
- `1-10`: Use a 1-10 scale for your ratings, where 1 represents the lowest quality and 10 represents the highest quality.
- `percentage`: Express your ratings as percentages, ranging from 0% (lowest quality) to 100% (highest quality).

## Examples

### Basic quality assessment of an analysis

```
+++QualityMetrics
My analysis of the financial market trends is as follows...
```

Provides the analysis of financial market trends, followed by 1-5 ratings across standard quality metrics with explanations for each score

### Specific custom metrics with detailed qualitative assessment

```
+++QualityMetrics(metrics=[factual accuracy,predictive value,consideration of alternatives,logical flow], scale=qualitative, explanation=true)
Here's my policy proposal for urban housing...
```

Delivers the policy proposal, followed by qualitative assessments (poor/fair/good/excellent) of the four specified metrics, with detailed explanations for each evaluation

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** After providing your main response on this topic, evaluate the quality of your own response. Rate it on these metrics: {metrics} using a {scale} scale. {explanation} Present this evaluation in a clear 'Quality Assessment' section at the end of your response. Be honest and critical in your self-assessment.

**Notes:** This model may need explicit instructions to be sufficiently critical in its self-assessment rather than defaulting to consistently high ratings


## Implementation Guidance

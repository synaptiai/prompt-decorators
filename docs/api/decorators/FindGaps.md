# FindGaps Decorator

Identifies missing elements, unanswered questions, or overlooked considerations in an idea, plan, or argument. This decorator helps improve completeness by systematically discovering and highlighting gaps that need addressing.

**Category**: Verification

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `aspects` | `enum` | The specific types of gaps to focus on finding | `comprehensive` |
| `depth` | `enum` | How thoroughly to analyze for gaps | `thorough` |
| `solutions` | `boolean` | Whether to suggest solutions or approaches for addressing the identified gaps | `True` |

## Aspects Options

- `questions`: Focus specifically on identifying unanswered questions and unresolved issues that need clarification.
- `resources`: Focus specifically on identifying missing resources, tools, skills, or capabilities needed for implementation or success.
- `stakeholders`: Focus specifically on identifying overlooked stakeholders, individuals, or groups whose perspectives or needs are not adequately addressed.
- `risks`: Focus specifically on identifying potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities that have not been adequately considered.
- `dependencies`: Focus specifically on identifying overlooked dependencies, prerequisites, or contingencies that could affect implementation or outcomes.
- `comprehensive`: Comprehensively identify gaps across multiple dimensions, including questions, resources, stakeholders, risks, and dependencies.

## Depth Options

- `basic`: Conduct a focused analysis to identify the most obvious and critical gaps.
- `thorough`: Conduct a detailed analysis to identify both obvious and subtle gaps that might significantly impact outcomes.
- `exhaustive`: Conduct an extremely comprehensive analysis to identify all possible gaps, including edge cases and minor considerations.

## Examples

### Basic comprehensive gap analysis of a business plan

```
+++FindGaps
We plan to launch our SaaS product with these features and marketing channels...
```

First identifies gaps across various aspects of the SaaS product launch plan, then suggests solutions for addressing each gap

### Exhaustive stakeholder-focused gap analysis without solutions

```
+++FindGaps(aspects=stakeholders, depth=exhaustive, solutions=false)
Here's our urban redevelopment proposal...
```

Provides an exhaustive analysis of overlooked or inadequately considered stakeholders in the urban redevelopment proposal, without suggesting solutions

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** First analyze this content carefully. Then identify missing or overlooked {aspects} using a {depth} approach. For each gap found, clearly explain why it matters and how it could impact outcomes. {solutions} Be specific and constructive in your gap analysis.

**Notes:** This model sometimes needs more explicit instruction to go beyond surface-level analysis and identify non-obvious gaps

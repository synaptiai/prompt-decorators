# SystemIntegration Decorator

Provides guidance for integrating with existing systems and services.

**Category**: Implementation-Focused

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `systems` | `string` | External systems to integrate with | `none` |
| `approach` | `enum` | Integration approach | `adapter` |
| `coupling` | `enum` | Desired coupling level | `loose` |

## Approach Options

- `adapter`: Use an adapter pattern to create a compatible interface between systems.
- `direct`: Implement direct integration with minimal abstraction layers.
- `facade`: Create a facade to provide a simplified interface to the complex subsystems.
- `proxy`: Implement a proxy pattern to control access to the external systems.
- `bridge`: Use a bridge pattern to decouple abstraction from implementation.

## Coupling Options

- `loose`: Maintain loose coupling to minimize dependencies between systems.
- `moderate`: Balance coupling with performance considerations.
- `tight`: Implement tight coupling where performance is critical.

## Examples

### Basic integration with payment gateway using facade pattern

```
+++SystemIntegration(systems=payment-gateway,inventory-service, approach=facade, coupling=loose)
```

Provides guidance for implementing a facade-based integration with payment gateway and inventory services while maintaining loose coupling.

### Direct integration with tight coupling for performance

```
+++SystemIntegration(systems=database, approach=direct, coupling=tight)
```

Guides implementation of direct database integration with tight coupling for performance-critical operations.

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** When implementing the solution, consider these system integration guidelines:

**Notes:** Simplified instruction for models with less context capacity.


## Implementation Guidance

### E-commerce application

**Original Prompt:**
```
Implement an order processing service that integrates with our payment gateway and inventory system.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Consider the following system integration requirements when developing your solution:
Integrate with the following systems: payment-gateway,inventory-service.
Create a facade to provide a simplified interface to the complex subsystems.
Maintain loose coupling to minimize dependencies between systems.

Implement an order processing service that integrates with our payment gateway and inventory system.
```

**Notes:** The decorator adds specific integration guidance while preserving the original implementation request.

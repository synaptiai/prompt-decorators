# Schema Decorator

Defines a custom structure for the AI's response using a specified schema format. This decorator enables precise control over the output structure, ensuring responses follow a consistent, well-defined format optimized for specific use cases or data processing needs.

**Category**: Structure

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `schema` | `string` | JSON Schema definition or reference to a predefined schema that defines the structure of the response | `Required` |
| `strict` | `boolean` | Whether to enforce strict schema compliance or allow flexibility | `False` |

## Examples

### Basic schema for a person's information

```
+++Schema(schema={"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},"age":{"type":"number"},"interests":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}}})
Describe a fictional character.
```

Returns information about a fictional character structured according to the specified schema with name, age, and interests

### Strict schema for product information

```
+++Schema(schema={"type":"object","required":["productName","price","features"],"properties":{"productName":{"type":"string"},"price":{"type":"number"},"features":{"type":"array"},"availability":{"type":"boolean"}}}, strict=true)
Describe a smartphone.
```

Returns smartphone information strictly following the specified schema with all required fields and proper data types

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Format your entire response according to this schema: {schema}

Make sure to follow the exact data types and structure. {strict} Present the final output as valid JSON that follows this schema precisely. Do not include markdown code blocks or any explanatory text outside the JSON structure.

**Notes:** This model may need explicit reminders to avoid adding explanatory text outside the schema structure, especially for complex schemas


## Implementation Guidance

### Character description with basic schema

**Original Prompt:**
```
Describe a fictional character.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please structure your response according to the following schema definition. Ensure that your content follows this specific structure while maintaining the information's accuracy and completeness. Use this specific schema definition to structure your response: {"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},"age":{"type":"number"},"interests":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}}}. Make sure your content adheres to all property types and constraints defined in the schema. Apply the schema as a general guide, allowing reasonable flexibility while maintaining the core structure. You may include additional helpful information if it enhances understanding.

Describe a fictional character.
```

### Strict schema for smartphone description

**Original Prompt:**
```
Describe a smartphone.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please structure your response according to the following schema definition. Ensure that your content follows this specific structure while maintaining the information's accuracy and completeness. Use this specific schema definition to structure your response: {"type":"object","required":["productName","price","features"],"properties":{"productName":{"type":"string"},"price":{"type":"number"},"features":{"type":"array"},"availability":{"type":"boolean"}}}. Make sure your content adheres to all property types and constraints defined in the schema. Apply the schema definition strictly, ensuring perfect compliance with all property types, required fields, and constraints without any deviations or additional properties.

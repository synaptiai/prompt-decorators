# Architecture Decorator

Generates architectural designs based on requirements and constraints.

**Category**: Architecture And Design

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `style` | `enum` | Architectural pattern | `requirements-dependent` |
| `detail` | `enum` | Level of design detail | `component` |
| `focus` | `enum` | Design emphasis | `balanced` |

## Style Options

- `microservices`: Design using a microservices architecture with loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
- `monolith`: Design using a monolithic architecture with a unified codebase and deployment unit.
- `serverless`: Design using a serverless architecture with function-as-a-service components.
- `event-driven`: Design using an event-driven architecture with asynchronous communication patterns.
- `layered`: Design using a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns between layers.
- `hexagonal`: Design using a hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture to separate business logic from external concerns.
- `ddd`: Design using Domain-Driven Design principles with bounded contexts and a ubiquitous language.

## Detail Options

- `overview`: Provide a high-level architectural overview with major components and their relationships.
- `component`: Detail the component-level design including interfaces, responsibilities, and interactions.
- `detailed`: Create a detailed design including data structures, APIs, deployment considerations, and implementation guidance.

## Focus Options

- `scalability`: Optimize the architecture for scalability, ensuring it can handle increasing loads and users.
- `maintainability`: Optimize the architecture for maintainability, ensuring it can be easily understood and modified.
- `performance`: Optimize the architecture for performance, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.
- `security`: Optimize the architecture for security, protecting against threats and vulnerabilities.
- `cost`: Optimize the architecture for cost-efficiency, minimizing resource usage and operational expenses.
- `balanced`: Balance all quality attributes including scalability, maintainability, performance, security, and cost.

## Examples

### Microservices architecture for a video streaming platform

```
+++Architecture(style=microservices, detail=component, focus=scalability)
Design an architecture for a video streaming platform that needs to support millions of concurrent users.
```

A component-level microservices architecture optimized for scalability, with separate services for user management, content delivery, recommendation engine, and analytics.

### Serverless architecture for an e-commerce application

```
+++Architecture(style=serverless, detail=detailed, focus=cost)
Design an architecture for an e-commerce platform that processes orders and manages inventory.
```

A detailed serverless architecture optimized for cost efficiency, using functions for order processing, inventory updates, and payment handling with appropriate data stores and API gateways.

### Event-driven architecture for a financial system

```
+++Architecture(style=event-driven, detail=overview, focus=security)
Design an architecture for a banking system that handles transactions and account management.
```

A high-level overview of an event-driven architecture optimized for security, showing event flows between account management, transaction processing, and notification components with security controls.

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Create an architectural design diagram and explanation for the following requirements. Consider the architectural style, level of detail, and focus areas specified.

**Notes:** For models with more limited context, simplify the architectural descriptions and focus on key components.

### gpt-4o

**Instruction:** Generate a comprehensive architectural design that addresses the requirements and constraints. Include diagrams, component descriptions, interaction patterns, and justifications for your design decisions.

**Notes:** gpt-4o can handle more complex architectural descriptions and provide more detailed diagrams and rationales.


## Implementation Guidance

### Web application architecture

**Original Prompt:**
```
Design an architecture for a video streaming platform that needs to support millions of concurrent users.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Generate an architectural design that addresses the requirements and constraints. Consider trade-offs and justify your design decisions. Design using a microservices architecture with loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Detail the component-level design including interfaces, responsibilities, and interactions. Optimize the architecture for scalability, ensuring it can handle increasing loads and users.

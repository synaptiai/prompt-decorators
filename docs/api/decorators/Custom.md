# Custom Decorator

A meta-decorator that enables user-defined decorator behaviors through explicit rules or instructions. This provides maximum flexibility for creating specialized behaviors not covered by standard decorators.

**Category**: Meta

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `rules` | `string` | Explicit instructions defining the custom behavior (e.g., 'present all examples in a numbered list with exactly three items') | `Required` |
| `name` | `string` | Optional name for the custom decorator to reference in documentation or explanations | `` |
| `priority` | `enum` | How to prioritize custom rules relative to other decorators | `override` |

## Priority Options

- `override`: These custom rules should override any conflicting instructions from other decorators.
- `supplement`: These custom rules should supplement other decorators, but defer to them in case of direct conflicts.
- `fallback`: Apply these custom rules only when no other decorator provides specific guidance on a particular aspect.

## Examples

### Basic custom formatting rule

```
+++Custom(rules=every paragraph must start with a word that begins with the letter A)
Explain how search engines work.
```

Provides an explanation of search engines where every paragraph begins with a word starting with the letter A

### Complex custom behavior with named reference

```
+++Custom(name=DualPerspective, rules=present two contrasting viewpoints on each main point, label them as 'Perspective A' and 'Perspective B', and then provide a synthesis, priority=supplement)
Analyze the impact of social media on politics.
```

Analyzes social media's impact on politics using dual contrasting perspectives for each point, labeled as specified, with synthesis after each point, while still respecting other decorators

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4o

# TestStrategy Decorator

Designs comprehensive testing approaches for software components or systems.

**Category**: Testing And Debugging

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `level` | enum | Testing scope level | unit |
| `framework` | enum | Testing framework to use | language-appropriate |
| `approach` | enum | Testing methodology | tdd |

## Level Options

- `unit`: Focus on unit testing individual components in isolation.
- `integration`: Design integration tests that verify interactions between components.
- `e2e`: Create end-to-end tests that validate complete user workflows.
- `performance`: Develop performance tests to measure system responsiveness and stability under load.
- `security`: Implement security tests to identify vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.

## Framework Options

- `jest`: Use Jest as the testing framework.
- `pytest`: Implement tests using the pytest framework.
- `junit`: Develop tests with the JUnit framework.
- `mocha`: Create tests using the Mocha framework.
- `cypress`: Build tests with the Cypress framework.

## Approach Options

- `tdd`: Follow Test-Driven Development methodology (write tests before implementation).
- `bdd`: Use Behavior-Driven Development with descriptive scenarios that reflect user requirements.
- `property`: Implement property-based testing to verify invariants across many generated inputs.
- `snapshot`: Utilize snapshot testing to detect unexpected UI or data structure changes.

## Examples

### Integration testing strategy for an authentication service

```
+++TestStrategy(level=integration, framework=jest, approach=bdd)
Design a testing strategy for an authentication service with database and external API dependencies.
```

A comprehensive integration testing strategy using Jest and BDD approach, focusing on testing interactions between the authentication service, database, and external APIs.

### Unit testing strategy with default parameters

```
+++TestStrategy()
Design tests for a string manipulation utility library.
```

A unit testing strategy using TDD methodology with an appropriate framework for the implementation language, focusing on testing individual functions in isolation.

### Performance testing for a high-traffic API

```
+++TestStrategy(level=performance, framework=junit)
Create tests for a payment processing API that handles 1000 transactions per second.
```

A performance testing strategy using JUnit to measure throughput, response time, and stability of the payment API under high load conditions.

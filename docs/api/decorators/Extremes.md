# Extremes Decorator

Presents content at the extreme ends of a spectrum, showing both a radical, ambitious, or maximalist version alongside a minimal, conservative, or basic version. This decorator helps explore the range of possibilities from the simplest implementation to the most expansive vision.

**Category**: Tone

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `versions` | `enum` | Which extreme versions to include | `both` |
| `dimension` | `string` | The specific dimension along which to explore extremes (e.g., 'cost', 'time', 'ambition', 'complexity') | `ambition` |
| `compare` | `boolean` | Whether to include a comparative analysis of the extreme versions | `True` |

## Versions Options

- `radical`: Focus exclusively on presenting a radical, ambitious, or maximalist version that pushes boundaries and represents the most expansive vision possible.
- `minimal`: Focus exclusively on presenting a minimal, conservative, or basic version that emphasizes simplicity, feasibility, and immediate implementability.
- `both`: Present both a radical, ambitious version and a minimal, conservative version, clearly contrasting these opposite approaches.

## Examples

### Basic exploration of minimal and radical approaches

```
+++Extremes
Describe a strategy for reducing carbon emissions.
```

Presents both a minimal, immediately achievable carbon reduction strategy and a radical, transformative approach, with a comparison of their respective impacts, feasibility, and trade-offs

### Only radical version along a specific dimension

```
+++Extremes(versions=radical, dimension=technological innovation, compare=false)
Outline the future of transportation.
```

Provides only a technologically radical vision of transportation's future, focusing on the most innovative and disruptive possibilities without comparison to other approaches

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Present {versions} versions of this topic along the spectrum of {dimension}. If showing a minimal version, focus on what's practical, immediately achievable, and conservative. If showing a radical version, explore ambitious, transformative possibilities that push boundaries. {compare} Make the contrast between approaches very clear, and ensure each version is fully developed.

**Notes:** This model sometimes needs reminders to ensure the radical version is truly ambitious and not just a moderate enhancement of conventional approaches


## Implementation Guidance

### Radical and minimal carbon reduction strategies

**Original Prompt:**
```
Describe a strategy for reducing carbon emissions.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please present content at the extreme ends of a spectrum, exploring the range of possibilities from minimalist to maximalist approaches. Clearly contrast different versions that represent opposite ends of implementation or conceptualization. Present both a radical, ambitious version and a minimal, conservative version, clearly contrasting these opposite approaches. Explore the extremes specifically along the dimension of ambition, focusing on how this particular aspect varies between minimal and maximal implementations. Include an explicit comparative analysis of the extreme versions, highlighting the trade-offs, advantages, and disadvantages of each approach.

```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please present content at the extreme ends of a spectrum, exploring the range of possibilities from minimalist to maximalist approaches. Clearly contrast different versions that represent opposite ends of implementation or conceptualization. Focus exclusively on presenting a radical, ambitious, or maximalist version that pushes boundaries and represents the most expansive vision possible. Explore the extremes specifically along the dimension of technological innovation, focusing on how this particular aspect varies between minimal and maximal implementations. Present the extreme versions without explicit comparison, allowing each to stand on its own merits.

- **Alternatives**: Enhances Extremes Extremes complements Alternatives by specifically focusing on opposite ends of a spectrum while Alternatives generates distinct options
- **Constraints**: Enhances Extremes Constraints can help define the parameters for the minimal version in the Extremes decorator
- **Balanced**: Conflicts with Extremes Extremes intentionally presents polarized views rather than the balanced perspective promoted by the Balanced decorator

# LoggingStrategy Decorator

Defines a strategy for implementing logging to aid debugging and monitoring.

**Category**: Systematic Debugging

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `level` | enum | Logging detail level | standard |
| `targets` | enum | Logging targets | console |
| `lifecycle` | enum | Log lifecycle management | temporary |

## Level Options

- `minimal`: Implement minimal logging that captures only critical events and errors.
- `standard`: Implement standard logging that captures important application events, errors, and basic flow information.
- `verbose`: Implement verbose logging that captures detailed information about application flow, state changes, and all significant events.
- `diagnostic`: Implement diagnostic logging that captures comprehensive details about internal operations, variable states, and system interactions for troubleshooting purposes.

## Targets Options

- `console`: Direct logs to the console or standard output.
- `file`: Write logs to persistent files with appropriate rotation and management.
- `service`: Send logs to a dedicated logging service or aggregator.
- `all`: Implement multiple logging targets including console, file, and service integration.

## Lifecycle Options

- `temporary`: Implement logging as a temporary measure that can be easily removed when no longer needed.
- `permanent`: Implement logging as a permanent part of the system architecture.
- `conditional`: Implement conditional logging that activates based on environment variables or configuration.
- `togglable`: Implement logging that can be dynamically enabled or disabled at runtime.

## Examples

### Implementing diagnostic logging for authentication flow

```
+++LoggingStrategy(level=diagnostic, targets=console, lifecycle=togglable)
Implement comprehensive logging for the authentication flow that can be enabled/disabled with a debug flag.
```

The model will generate code for an authentication flow with detailed diagnostic logging that outputs to the console and can be toggled on/off via a debug flag.

### Standard file logging for production environment

```
+++LoggingStrategy(level=standard, targets=file, lifecycle=permanent)
Create a user registration system with appropriate logging.
```

The model will implement a user registration system with standard-level logging written to files as a permanent part of the system.

### Minimal conditional logging for performance-sensitive operations

```
+++LoggingStrategy(level=minimal, targets=service, lifecycle=conditional)
Write a high-performance data processing function.
```

The model will create a high-performance function with minimal logging sent to a service, activated only under specific conditions to minimize performance impact.

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-3.5-turbo

**Instruction:** Add logging to the code with the following characteristics: {level} detail level, output to {targets}, and {lifecycle} persistence.

**Notes:** Simplified instruction format works better with GPT-3.5 Turbo.


## Compatibility

- **Requires**: None
- **Conflicts**: None
- **Compatible Models**: gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, claude-2, llama-2

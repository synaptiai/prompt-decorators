# Optimize Decorator

Optimizes code for specific metrics while respecting constraints.

**Category**: Code Generation

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `for` | `enum` | The primary optimization target | `speed` |
| `constraints` | `enum` | Limitations that must be respected | `none` |
| `priority` | `enum` | Trade-off preference when optimizations conflict | `balanced` |

## For Options

- `speed`: execution speed and performance
- `memory`: memory usage and efficiency
- `readability`: code clarity and maintainability
- `size`: code size and compactness
- `network`: network efficiency and reduced data transfer

## Constraints Options

- `backwards-compatible`: maintaining backward compatibility
- `minimal-changes`: making minimal changes to the original code
- `no-external-dependencies`: using no additional external dependencies
- `same-api`: preserving the same API interface
- `none`: Option: none

## Priority Options

- `max-gains`: maximum optimization gains even if it involves more risk
- `min-risk`: minimal risk approaches even if the optimization gains are smaller
- `balanced`: a balanced approach between optimization gains and risk

## Examples

### Optimizing code for memory usage with backward compatibility

```
+++Optimize(for=memory, constraints=backwards-compatible, priority=min-risk)
Optimize this image processing function that's consuming too much memory.
```

The model will optimize the code focusing on memory efficiency, while ensuring backward compatibility and taking a conservative approach to changes.

### Optimizing for speed with default constraints

```
+++Optimize(for=speed)
Make this sorting algorithm faster.
```

The model will focus on improving execution speed with balanced risk approach and no specific constraints.

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Please optimize this code for {for}, making sure to follow these constraints: {constraints}. When there are trade-offs to make, prioritize {priority}.

**Notes:** More explicit instruction format works better with this model.


## Implementation Guidance

### Python code optimization

**Original Prompt:**
```
Optimize this image processing function that's consuming too much memory:

def process_image(image):
    result = []
    for x in range(image.width):
        for y in range(image.height):
            pixel = image.get_pixel(x, y)
            result.append(transform_pixel(pixel))
    return result
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Optimize the code for memory usage and efficiency while respecting maintaining backward compatibility. When optimizations conflict, prioritize minimal risk approaches even if the optimization gains are smaller.

Optimize this image processing function that's consuming too much memory:

def process_image(image):
    result = []
    for x in range(image.width):
        for y in range(image.height):
            pixel = image.get_pixel(x, y)
            result.append(transform_pixel(pixel))
    return result
```

**Notes:** The decorator prepends specific optimization instructions while preserving the original request.

## Transformation Details

**Base Instruction:** Optimize the code for {for} while respecting the following constraints: {constraints}. When optimizations conflict, prioritize {priority}.

**Placement:** prepend

**Composition Behavior:** accumulate

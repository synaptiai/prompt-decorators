# Outline Decorator

Structures the response as a hierarchical outline with headings and subheadings. This decorator organizes information in a clear, logical structure that highlights relationships between main topics and subtopics.

**Category**: Structure

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `depth` | `number` | Maximum nesting level of the outline | `3` |
| `style` | `enum` | Numbering or bullet style for the outline | `numeric` |
| `detailed` | `boolean` | Whether to include brief explanations under each outline point | `False` |

## Style Options

- `numeric`: Use numeric notation (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.) for all outline levels.
- `bullet`: Use bullet point notation (•, ○, ▪, etc.) for all outline levels.
- `roman`: Use Roman numeral notation (I, II, III, etc. for top level, then A, B, C, etc. for second level).
- `alpha`: Use alphabetical notation (A, B, C, etc. for top level, then 1, 2, 3, etc. for second level).
- `mixed`: Use a mix of notation styles: numbers for level 1, letters for level 2, Roman numerals for level 3, etc.

## Examples

### Simple numeric outline of a complex topic

```
+++Outline
Explain the structure of the United States government.
```

Presents the US government structure as a numbered outline with up to 3 levels of hierarchy

### Detailed outline with mixed notation and deep hierarchy

```
+++Outline(style=mixed, depth=5, detailed=true)
Provide a comprehensive overview of machine learning techniques.
```

Creates a 5-level deep outline using mixed notation (numbers, letters, roman numerals) with brief explanations under each point, covering machine learning techniques

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Format your response as an outline with clear hierarchical structure. Use headings and subheadings with consistent formatting for each level.

**Notes:** This model may need more explicit instructions about maintaining consistent outline formatting


## Implementation Guidance

### Standard numeric outline

**Original Prompt:**
```
Explain the structure of the United States government.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please structure your response as a hierarchical outline with headings and subheadings to organize the information clearly. Use a maximum of 3 levels of nesting in the hierarchy. Use numeric notation (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.) for all outline levels. Keep the outline concise with headings only, without additional explanations under each point.

### Detailed mixed-style outline

**Original Prompt:**
```
Provide a comprehensive overview of machine learning techniques.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please structure your response as a hierarchical outline with headings and subheadings to organize the information clearly. Use a maximum of 5 levels of nesting in the hierarchy. Use a mix of notation styles: numbers for level 1, letters for level 2, Roman numerals for level 3, etc. Include a brief explanation or description under each outline point to provide context.

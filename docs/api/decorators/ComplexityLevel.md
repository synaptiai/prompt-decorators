# ComplexityLevel Decorator

Specifies the permitted complexity level for the implementation.

**Category**: Implementation-Focused

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `code` | `enum` | Code complexity limit | `moderate` |
| `concepts` | `enum` | Conceptual complexity limit | `intermediate` |
| `dependencies` | `enum` | External dependency usage | `standard` |

## Code Options

- `simple`: Use simple, straightforward code structures. Avoid complex algorithms or patterns.
- `moderate`: Balance simplicity with efficiency. Use standard patterns where appropriate.
- `complex`: Optimize for performance and scalability. Use advanced patterns when beneficial.
- `necessary-only`: Use only the complexity that is absolutely necessary for the task.

## Concepts Options

- `beginner-friendly`: Use only basic concepts that beginners would understand. Explain any non-trivial concepts.
- `intermediate`: You can use intermediate-level concepts that most practitioners would be familiar with.
- `advanced`: You can use advanced concepts and techniques appropriate for experienced developers.

## Dependencies Options

- `none`: Do not use any external dependencies or libraries.
- `minimal`: Use only essential dependencies. Prefer standard libraries when possible.
- `standard`: Use common, well-established dependencies as needed.
- `whatever-needed`: Use any dependencies that would make the implementation better, regardless of number.

## Examples

### Simple date formatter with beginner-friendly concepts

```
+++ComplexityLevel(code=simple, concepts=beginner-friendly, dependencies=minimal)
Implement a simple date formatter utility that converts between different date formats without external libraries.
```

The model will provide a simple date formatter implementation using only basic programming concepts and minimal dependencies, suitable for beginners.

### Complex algorithm with standard dependencies

```
+++ComplexityLevel(code=complex, concepts=advanced, dependencies=standard)
Implement a machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis.
```

The model will provide an optimized, advanced implementation using standard libraries and frameworks appropriate for experienced developers.

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Implement this with the following complexity constraints: {code_complexity}, {concept_complexity}, {dependency_usage}.

**Notes:** More explicit phrasing works better with this model.


## Implementation Guidance

### Web development task

**Original Prompt:**
```
Create a function to validate email addresses.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please implement this with appropriate complexity constraints. Use simple, straightforward code structures. Avoid complex algorithms or patterns. Use only basic concepts that beginners would understand. Explain any non-trivial concepts. Use only essential dependencies. Prefer standard libraries when possible.

Create a function to validate email addresses.
```

**Notes:** The transformed prompt guides the model to create a simple implementation with minimal dependencies that would be understandable to beginners.

## Related Decorators

- **LanguagePreference**: Enhances ComplexityLevel ComplexityLevel works well with LanguagePreference to specify both the programming language and its complexity level.
- **OptimizationFocus**: Conflicts with ComplexityLevel May conflict with OptimizationFocus if that decorator requests optimizations that would increase complexity beyond the specified level.

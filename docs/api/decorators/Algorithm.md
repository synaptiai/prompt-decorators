## Examples

### Implementing a graph algorithm with linear complexity using an iterative approach

```
+++Algorithm(type=graph, complexity=linear, approach=iterative)
Implement an algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
```

The model will implement a breadth-first search algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, using an iterative approach with O(n) time complexity.

### Implementing a sorting algorithm with optimal complexity

```
+++Algorithm(type=sorting, complexity=linearithmic)
Implement a stable sorting algorithm for an array of integers.
```

The model will implement a merge sort algorithm, which is stable and has O(n log n) time complexity.

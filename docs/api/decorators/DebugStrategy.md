# DebugStrategy Decorator

Specifies the overall approach to debugging and problem analysis.

**Category**: Systematic Debugging

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `approach` | `enum` | Debugging methodology | `systematic` |
| `verbosity` | `enum` | Debug output verbosity | `standard` |
| `priority` | `enum` | Issue resolution priority | `functionality` |

## Approach Options

- `systematic`: Use a systematic step-by-step debugging approach to identify and resolve issues.
- `incremental`: Debug incrementally by making small changes and testing after each modification.
- `root-cause`: Focus on identifying the underlying root cause rather than addressing symptoms.
- `isolation`: Isolate components to determine which specific part is causing the issue.
- `comparison`: Compare working and non-working states to identify differences causing the problem.

## Verbosity Options

- `minimal`: Provide only essential information about the debugging process and findings.
- `standard`: Include a balanced amount of detail about the debugging process and findings.
- `verbose`: Provide detailed explanations of each debugging step and observation.
- `comprehensive`: Document exhaustively all aspects of the debugging process, including all tests performed and results observed.

## Priority Options

- `functionality`: Prioritize restoring basic functionality over other concerns.
- `performance`: Focus on optimizing performance aspects of the solution.
- `ux`: Emphasize user experience considerations in the debugging process.
- `security`: Prioritize security implications and vulnerabilities in the debugging process.

## Examples

### Root cause analysis of an authentication issue

```
+++DebugStrategy(approach=root-cause, verbosity=verbose, priority=functionality)
Debug the authentication failure that occurs when users attempt to log in with social credentials. Identify the exact point of failure.
```

A detailed analysis focusing on finding the root cause of the authentication failure, with verbose explanations of each debugging step, prioritizing the restoration of functionality.

### Minimal debugging of a performance issue

```
+++DebugStrategy(approach=isolation, verbosity=minimal, priority=performance)
The application becomes slow after processing large datasets. Debug the performance bottleneck.
```

A concise analysis that isolates components to identify performance bottlenecks, with minimal explanatory text, focusing on performance optimization.

## Implementation Guidance

### Software development debugging

**Original Prompt:**
```
Debug the authentication failure that occurs when users attempt to log in with social credentials. Identify the exact point of failure.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Apply a structured debugging approach to analyze and solve the problem. Focus on identifying the underlying root cause rather than addressing symptoms. Provide detailed explanations of each debugging step and observation. Prioritize restoring basic functionality over other concerns.

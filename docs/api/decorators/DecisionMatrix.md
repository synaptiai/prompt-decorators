# DecisionMatrix Decorator

Structures the response as a decision matrix, evaluating options against multiple criteria. This decorator facilitates systematic comparison and selection between alternatives based on weighted or unweighted criteria.

**Category**: Structure

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `options` | `array` | Specific options or alternatives to evaluate in the matrix | `` |
| `criteria` | `array` | Evaluation criteria to assess each option against | `` |
| `weighted` | `boolean` | Whether to include weights for criteria importance | `False` |
| `scale` | `enum` | Rating scale to use for evaluations | `1-5` |

## Scale Options

- `1-5`: Use a 1-5 rating scale for each criterion (where 1 is poor/lowest and 5 is excellent/highest).
- `1-10`: Use a 1-10 rating scale for each criterion (where 1 is poor/lowest and 10 is excellent/highest).
- `qualitative`: Use qualitative ratings (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent) for each criterion.
- `percentage`: Use percentage scores (0-100%) for rating each criterion.

## Examples

### Simple decision matrix for comparing options

```
+++DecisionMatrix
What smartphone should I buy?
```

Creates a decision matrix comparing top smartphone options against key purchasing criteria, with 1-5 ratings for each combination

### Weighted decision matrix with custom options and criteria

```
+++DecisionMatrix(options=[Python,JavaScript,Go,Rust], criteria=[learning curve,performance,ecosystem,job market], weighted=true, scale=1-10)
Which programming language should I learn next?
```

Generates a weighted decision matrix comparing the specified programming languages against the given criteria, with weighted scores on a 1-10 scale

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Create a decision matrix comparing {options} against {criteria}. Rate each option-criterion pair using a {scale} scale. {weighted} Include a brief explanation for each rating, and conclude with a recommendation based on the matrix results.

**Notes:** This model sometimes needs more explicit instructions about formatting the matrix clearly and providing final scores


## Implementation Guidance

### Simple smartphone comparison

**Original Prompt:**
```
What smartphone should I buy?
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please structure your response as a decision matrix that systematically evaluates options against multiple criteria to facilitate comparison and selection. Use a 1-5 rating scale for each criterion (where 1 is poor/lowest and 5 is excellent/highest). Evaluate all criteria with equal importance, without applying weights to the scores.

```

### Detailed programming language comparison with weights

**Original Prompt:**
```
Which programming language should I learn next?
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Please structure your response as a decision matrix that systematically evaluates options against multiple criteria to facilitate comparison and selection. Evaluate these specific options or alternatives in your matrix: Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust. Assess each option against these specific criteria: learning curve, performance, ecosystem, job market. Include weight factors for each criterion to reflect their relative importance, and calculate weighted scores for each option. Use a 1-10 rating scale for each criterion (where 1 is poor/lowest and 10 is excellent/highest).

- `options`:
  - Format: Evaluate these specific options or alternatives in your matrix: {value}.

- `criteria`:
  - Format: Assess each option against these specific criteria: {value}.

- `weighted`:
  - When set to `true`: Include weight factors for each criterion to reflect their relative importance, and calculate weighted scores for each option.
  - When set to `false`: Evaluate all criteria with equal importance, without applying weights to the scores.

- `scale`:

## Domain Options

- `business`: Use a business-oriented cascade that explores: 1) Operational considerations, 2) Human/stakeholder impacts, 3) Organizational culture implications, 4) Market/competitive positioning.
- `product`: Use a product development cascade that explores: 1) User needs and pain points, 2) Technical feasibility and constraints, 3) Market viability and positioning, 4) Future adaptability and scaling.
- `research`: Use a research-oriented cascade that explores: 1) Methodological approaches, 2) Theoretical frameworks, 3) Practical implementation considerations, 4) Implications and applications.
- `problem-solving`: Use a problem-solving cascade that explores: 1) Problem definition and framing, 2) Causal factors and systems analysis, 3) Solution approaches and evaluation, 4) Implementation and adaptation.
- `decision-making`: Use a decision-making cascade that explores: 1) Practical considerations, 2) Ethical dimensions, 3) Strategic alignment, 4) Emotional and intuitive aspects.
- `content-creation`: Use a content-creation cascade that explores: 1) Core message and purpose, 2) Audience needs and perspectives, 3) Format and delivery considerations, 4) Engagement and impact potential.
- `negotiation`: Use a negotiation-focused cascade that explores: 1) Your interests and priorities, 2) Counterparty perspectives and needs, 3) Contextual factors and constraints, 4) Creative options and integrative solutions.
- `custom`: Develop a custom perspective cascade appropriate to the specific topic and context.

## Integrationlevel Options

- `basic`: Ensure basic connections between perspectives, highlighting key relationship points.
- `moderate`: Create moderate integration with explicit connections and reflections on how each perspective transforms understanding of previous viewpoints.
- `comprehensive`: Implement comprehensive integration where perspectives deeply inform each other, with explicit synthesis of insights across the full cascade.

## Interactionstyle Options

- `guided`: Guide the user through each perspective with explicit questions to elicit their input before moving to the next perspective.
- `autonomous`: Present the full cascade of perspectives with minimal interruption, providing a comprehensive analysis.
- `hybrid`: Balance guidance and autonomy by presenting initial perspectives, then pausing for input at key integration points.

## Examples

### Business strategy exploration

```
+++PerspectiveCascade(domain=business, perspectives=4, integrationLevel=comprehensive)
```

Analyzes business strategy through four perspectives (operational, human, cultural, and market) with comprehensive integration between viewpoints

### Product development with custom perspectives

```
+++PerspectiveCascade(customPerspectives=technical,financial,ethical,user-experience, integrationLevel=moderate)
```

Explores product development through a cascade of technical, financial, ethical, and user experience perspectives with moderate integration

## Implementation Guidance

### Corporate policy development

**Original Prompt:**
```
Help me develop a sustainability policy for my manufacturing company.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Approach this topic using Perspective Cascading, a method that systematically explores the subject through a sequence of diverse, interconnected viewpoints. Each new perspective should build upon previous ones while introducing novel elements, creating a flowing exploration that reveals insights at the boundaries between different perspectives. Use a business-oriented cascade that explores: 1) Operational considerations, 2) Human/stakeholder impacts, 3) Organizational culture implications, 4) Market/competitive positioning. Create moderate integration with explicit connections and reflections on how each perspective transforms understanding of previous viewpoints. Guide the user through each perspective with explicit questions to elicit their input before moving to the next perspective.

- `cloudwatch`: Leverage AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting capabilities.
- `newrelic`: Build the monitoring solution around New Relic's observability platform.
- `grafana`: Utilize Grafana for dashboarding, with appropriate data sources for collection.
- `elastic`: Implement using the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- `recommend`: Suggest the most appropriate monitoring tools based on the system requirements.

## Implementation Options

- `concepts`: Provide a high-level conceptual overview of the monitoring approach.
- `configuration`: Include specific configuration examples and implementation details.
- `full-setup`: Deliver comprehensive setup instructions with code samples and deployment guidance.

## Examples

### Performance monitoring for microservices

```
+++Monitoring(focus=performance, tools=prometheus, implementation=configuration)
Create a monitoring solution for our microservices architecture focusing on performance metrics and latency.
```

Provides a Prometheus-based monitoring configuration focused on performance metrics like request rates, latency distributions, and resource utilization for microservices.

### Security monitoring with comprehensive setup

```
+++Monitoring(focus=security, tools=elastic, implementation=full-setup)
We need to monitor our cloud infrastructure for potential security breaches.
```

Delivers a complete Elastic Stack setup with detailed implementation instructions for security monitoring, including log collection, SIEM rules, and security dashboards.

### Business metrics monitoring concepts

```
+++Monitoring(focus=business-metrics, implementation=concepts)
What should we monitor for our SaaS product?
```

Provides conceptual guidance on monitoring business KPIs for a SaaS product, including customer acquisition costs, churn rates, and lifetime value metrics.

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Create a monitoring setup for the system described below. Include specific tools, metrics to track, and alert configurations.

**Notes:** Simplified instruction for models with more limited context windows.


## Implementation Guidance

### Microservices Architecture

**Original Prompt:**
```
Create a monitoring solution for our microservices architecture focusing on performance metrics and latency.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Create a monitoring and alerting setup for the described system. Focus on providing practical, implementable monitoring solutions. Emphasize performance metrics, throughput, and latency monitoring. Use Prometheus and associated tools for metrics collection and alerting. Include specific configuration examples and implementation details.

```

**Notes:** This example shows how the decorator adds specific guidance for performance monitoring in a microservices context using Prometheus.

### E-commerce Platform

**Original Prompt:**
```
How should we monitor our e-commerce platform?
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Create a monitoring and alerting setup for the described system. Focus on providing practical, implementable monitoring solutions. Provide a balanced monitoring approach covering all critical aspects of the system. Suggest the most appropriate monitoring tools based on the system requirements. Include specific configuration examples and implementation details.

- `senior`: Explain the code with advanced concepts and patterns for a senior developer.
- `non-technical`: Explain the code in simple terms for someone without technical background.

## Examples

### Basic code walkthrough for junior developers

```
+++CodeWalkthrough(focus=how, detail=key-parts, audience=junior)
Walk through this authentication middleware explaining how it works.
```

A detailed explanation of how the authentication middleware works, focusing on key components and written for junior developers to understand.

### Security-focused code review for senior developers

```
+++CodeWalkthrough(focus=security, detail=line-by-line, audience=senior)
Explain this encryption implementation.
```

A comprehensive line-by-line security analysis of the encryption implementation, using advanced terminology appropriate for senior developers.

### High-level explanation for non-technical stakeholders

```
+++CodeWalkthrough(focus=why, detail=overview, audience=non-technical)
Explain what this payment processing code does.
```

A non-technical overview explaining why the payment processing code is designed the way it is, avoiding jargon and technical details.

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Explain this code in detail. Make sure to cover how it works, focusing on {focus}. Provide a {detail} explanation suitable for a {audience} developer.

**Notes:** Simplified instruction format works better with gpt-4-turbo.


## Implementation Guidance

### JavaScript authentication middleware

**Original Prompt:**
```
Walk through this authentication middleware explaining how it works.
```

**Transformed Prompt:**
```
Provide a walkthrough explanation of the code. Focus on making the explanation clear and educational. Explain how the code works, focusing on its mechanics and implementation details. Focus on explaining the key components and important sections of the code. Explain the code as you would to a peer developer with similar experience.

# Scalability Decorator

Designs for various dimensions of system scaling.

**Category**: Architecture And Design

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| `dimension` | `enum` | Scaling aspect to focus on | `users` |
| `target` | `enum` | Scale magnitude | `100x` |
| `approach` | `enum` | Scaling strategy | `horizontal` |

## Dimension Options

- `users`: Focus on scaling to support a growing user base with considerations for authentication, session management, and user experience.
- `data`: Focus on scaling data storage and retrieval systems with considerations for database sharding, replication, and data access patterns.
- `transactions`: Focus on scaling transaction processing capabilities with considerations for throughput, concurrency, and consistency.
- `geographic`: Focus on scaling across geographic regions with considerations for latency, data sovereignty, and regional availability.
- `complexity`: Focus on scaling to handle increasing system complexity with considerations for modularity, service boundaries, and technical debt.

## Target Options

- `10x`: Design for moderate growth, approximately 10 times current scale.
- `100x`: Design for significant growth, approximately 100 times current scale.
- `1000x`: Design for massive growth, approximately 1000 times current scale.
- `all`: Option: all

## Approach Options

- `horizontal`: Utilize horizontal scaling approaches by adding more machines or instances to distribute load.
- `vertical`: Utilize vertical scaling approaches by increasing the resources (CPU, memory, storage) of existing machines.
- `hybrid`: Utilize a hybrid scaling approach that combines both horizontal and vertical scaling strategies as appropriate.
- `cloud-native`: Utilize cloud-native architectures and services designed specifically for elastic scaling.

## Examples

### Designing a payment system for high transaction volume

```
+++Scalability(dimension=transactions, target=1000x, approach=horizontal)
Design a scalable payment processing system that can handle Black Friday-level traffic spikes.
```

A payment processing system design that focuses on transaction scalability, capable of handling 1000x normal load using horizontal scaling techniques appropriate for high-volume payment processing during peak events.

### Designing a social media platform for global user growth

```
+++Scalability(dimension=users, target=global, approach=cloud-native)
Design a social media platform architecture that can grow from regional to worldwide usage.
```

A social media platform architecture that focuses on user scalability, designed for global-scale deployment using cloud-native approaches to handle unlimited user growth across different regions.

## Model-Specific Implementations

### gpt-4-turbo

**Instruction:** Design a scalable system architecture with the following characteristics: {dimension} scaling to {target} levels using {approach} scaling approaches.

**Notes:** Simplified instruction format works better with gpt-4 Turbo's context handling.


## Implementation Guidance

### Web application architecture

**Original Prompt:**
```

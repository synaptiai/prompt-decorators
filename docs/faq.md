# Frequently Asked Questions

This document answers common questions about the Prompt Decorators framework.

## General Questions

### What is Prompt Decorators?

Prompt Decorators is a Python framework for enhancing prompts sent to Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a standardized way to modify how AI models process and respond to requests using a decorator pattern.

### How does it work?

The framework uses a simple syntax where decorators are prefixed with `+++` followed by a decorator name and optional parameters. These decorators are transformed into natural language instructions that LLMs can understand.

### What problem does it solve?

Prompt Decorators addresses several challenges:

1. **Consistency**: Provides a standardized way to enhance prompts across different LLMs
2. **Reusability**: Allows prompt enhancements to be reused across projects
3. **Composability**: Enables combining multiple enhancements for complex behaviors
4. **Maintainability**: Makes prompt engineering more structured and maintainable

### Which LLM providers are supported?

The framework is designed to work with any LLM provider, including:

- OpenAI (gpt-4, gpt-4o, etc.)
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Mistral AI
- Hugging Face models
- Local models

### Is it open source?

Yes, Prompt Decorators is open source under the MIT License, which allows for both personal and commercial use.

## Installation and Setup

### How do I install Prompt Decorators?

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install prompt-decorators
```

For additional features, you can install with extras:

```bash
# For MCP integration
pip install "prompt-decorators[mcp]"

# For development
pip install "prompt-decorators[dev,test,docs]"
```

### What are the system requirements?

- Python 3.11 or higher
- No special hardware requirements
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### How do I verify my installation?

```python
import prompt_decorators
print(prompt_decorators.__version__)
```

### Do I need API keys for LLM providers?

Yes, you'll need API keys for any LLM providers you want to use. The framework itself doesn't provide access to LLMs.

## Using Decorators

### How do I use decorators in my prompts?

Use the inline syntax directly in your prompts:

```python
prompt = """
+++StepByStep(numbered=true)
+++Audience(level="beginner")
Explain quantum computing.
"""

from prompt_decorators import apply_dynamic_decorators
transformed_prompt = apply_dynamic_decorators(prompt)
```

### Can I use decorators programmatically?

Yes, you can create and use decorator instances in your code:

```python
from prompt_decorators import create_decorator_instance

step_by_step = create_decorator_instance("StepByStep", numbered=True)
audience = create_decorator_instance("Audience", level="beginner")

original_prompt = "Explain quantum computing."
transformed_prompt = step_by_step(audience(original_prompt))
```

### How do I combine multiple decorators?

You can stack decorators either inline:

```
+++Persona(role="scientist")
+++StepByStep(numbered=true)
+++Audience(level="beginner")
Explain quantum computing.
```

Or programmatically:

```python
persona = create_decorator_instance("Persona", role="scientist")
step_by_step = create_decorator_instance("StepByStep", numbered=True)
audience = create_decorator_instance("Audience", level="beginner")

transformed_prompt = persona(step_by_step(audience(original_prompt)))
```

### What happens if decorators conflict?

When decorators have conflicting behaviors, the later decorator in the sequence takes precedence. For example, if you use both `Concise` and `Detailed`, the one that appears later will have more influence on the result.

### How many decorators can I use at once?

There's no hard limit on the number of decorators you can use, but consider:

1. **Token Usage**: Each decorator adds instructions that count toward token limits
2. **Clarity**: Too many decorators might create conflicting or confusing instructions
3. **Performance**: More decorators mean more processing time

A practical limit is typically 3-5 decorators per prompt.

## Available Decorators

### What decorators are included?

The framework includes over 140 pre-defined decorators in categories such as:

- **Reasoning**: Enhance logical thinking and problem-solving
- **Format**: Control output format and structure
- **Style**: Modify tone, voice, and writing style
- **Audience**: Target specific audiences
- **Persona**: Adopt specific roles or personalities
- **Domain**: Focus on specific knowledge domains
- **Length**: Control response length

### How do I see all available decorators?

```python
from prompt_decorators import get_available_decorators

decorators = get_available_decorators()
for decorator in decorators:
    print(f"{decorator.name}: {decorator.description}")
```

### What are the most commonly used decorators?

Some of the most popular decorators include:

- `StepByStep`: Breaks down responses into sequential steps
- `Reasoning`: Enhances logical reasoning in responses
- `Audience`: Adapts content for specific audience levels
- `Persona`: Adopts a specific role or personality
- `OutputFormat`: Controls the format of the output (markdown, JSON, etc.)
- `Concise`: Creates brief, to-the-point responses
- `Detailed`: Provides comprehensive, detailed responses

## Custom Decorators

### Can I create my own decorators?

Yes, you can create custom decorators using the `DecoratorDefinition` class:

```python
from prompt_decorators import DecoratorDefinition, register_decorator

my_decorator_def = DecoratorDefinition(
    name="MyCustomDecorator",
    description="A custom decorator that adds a prefix and suffix",
    category="Custom",
    parameters=[
        {"name": "prefix", "type": "string", "description": "Text to add before", "default": "START: "},
        {"name": "suffix", "type": "string", "description": "Text to add after", "default": " :END"}
    ],
    transform_function="return prefix + text + suffix;"
)

register_decorator(my_decorator_def)
```

### What language are transform functions written in?

Transform functions are written in JavaScript, which is executed in a sandboxed environment.

### Can I share my custom decorators?

Yes, you can share custom decorators by:

1. Creating a Python package with your decorator definitions
2. Sharing JSON files containing decorator definitions
3. Contributing to the main project

### How do I validate my custom decorators?

Use the validator tool to check your decorators:

```bash
python -m prompt_decorators.tools.validator validate my_decorator.json
```

You can also use the more comprehensive unified validator script:

```bash
# Validate decorator syntax in a prompt
python scripts/prompt_validator.py syntax -t "+++Reasoning(depth=comprehensive)\nExplain quantum computing."

# Validate a decorator schema file
python scripts/prompt_validator.py schema -f registry/core/reasoning/deductive.json
```

## Integrations

### How do I use Prompt Decorators with Claude Desktop?

1. Install the MCP integration:
   ```bash
   pip install "prompt-decorators[mcp]"
   ```

2. Run the Claude Desktop integration:
   ```bash
   python -m prompt_decorators.integrations.mcp.claude_desktop
   ```

3. In Claude Desktop, you'll see new tools available for working with decorators.

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol for integrating tools with LLM clients. Prompt Decorators provides an MCP integration that allows any MCP-compatible client to use decorators.

### Can I use Prompt Decorators in a web application?

Yes, you can integrate Prompt Decorators into web applications:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from prompt_decorators import apply_dynamic_decorators

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/generate")
async def generate(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    prompt = data.get("prompt", "")

    # Apply decorators
    transformed_prompt = apply_dynamic_decorators(prompt)

    # Send to LLM (implementation depends on your LLM client)
    response = your_llm_client.generate(transformed_prompt)

    return {"response": response}
```

## Performance and Limitations

### What is the performance impact?

The framework adds minimal overhead to prompt processing:

- Parsing decorators: microseconds to milliseconds
- Executing transform functions: milliseconds
- Overall impact: negligible compared to LLM API call time

### Are there token limits?

The framework itself doesn't impose token limits, but:

1. Each decorator adds instructions that count toward your LLM's token limits
2. More complex decorators add more tokens
3. Consider the token limits of your LLM provider

### Can decorators access external resources?

No, transform functions run in a sandboxed JavaScript environment and cannot access external resources like files, networks, or databases.

### Is there a rate limit?

The framework itself doesn't impose rate limits, but your LLM provider might have rate limits on API calls.

## Troubleshooting

### Why isn't my decorator being applied?

Common issues include:

1. **Syntax Errors**: Check that your decorator syntax is correct (`+++DecoratorName(param=value)`)
2. **Missing Registration**: Ensure the decorator is registered before use
3. **Name Typos**: Verify the decorator name is spelled correctly (case-sensitive)
4. **Parameter Errors**: Check that parameter names and values are correct

### Why am I getting "No decorators loaded" or "Registry is empty" errors?

This is a common issue that can occur when the package is installed without its built-in decorator definitions. Here's how to diagnose and fix it:

1. **Quick Verification**:
   ```bash
   python -m prompt_decorators verify
   ```

2. **Check Registry Status**:
   ```python
   from prompt_decorators import get_available_decorators
   decorators = get_available_decorators()
   print(f"Loaded decorators: {len(decorators)}")
   ```

3. **Auto-Repair**:
   ```bash
   python -m prompt_decorators repair
   ```

4. **Manual Fix**:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall prompt-decorators
   pip install --no-cache-dir prompt-decorators
   python -m prompt_decorators verify
   ```

This issue typically occurs when:
- The package was built without registry files
- Installation was incomplete
- Registry files were accidentally deleted

The auto-repair system will automatically detect and fix most registry issues.

### How do I debug decorator transformations?

Print the transformed prompt to see what's happening:

```python
from prompt_decorators import apply_dynamic_decorators

prompt = """
+++StepByStep(numbered=true)
Explain quantum computing.
"""

transformed_prompt = apply_dynamic_decorators(prompt)
print("Original prompt:", prompt)
print("Transformed prompt:", transformed_prompt)
```

### Why am I getting a "Decorator not found" error?

This error occurs when you reference a decorator that isn't registered. Ensure:

1. You've imported the decorator correctly
2. The decorator name is spelled correctly (case-sensitive)
3. Any custom decorators are registered before use

### How do I fix JavaScript errors in transform functions?

If you're getting JavaScript errors in your transform functions:

1. Check the syntax of your JavaScript code
2. Ensure all variables used in the function are defined
3. Verify that the function returns a string
4. Test the function with different inputs

- ✅ Implemented advanced usage patterns and combinations
- ✅ Developed domain-specific examples (healthcare, finance, etc.)
- ✅ Created interactive Jupyter notebook examples
- ✅ Added examples for telemetry and analytics
- ✅ Developed examples showing model-specific adaptations

### 3. Compatibility Documentation

## Document Statistics

| Document Type | Count | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| API Documentation | 65+ files | Complete |
| Usage Examples | 20+ files | Mostly Complete |
| Tutorials | 10+ files | Partially Complete |
| Guides | 5+ files | Partially Complete |

## Remaining Work

While significant progress has been made, some work remains to complete Phase 5:

1. **Documentation Navigation System**
   - Add comprehensive sidebar navigation
   - Implement breadcrumbs and "previous/next" links

2. **Additional Examples**
   - Create examples for different LLM providers
   - Implement examples for various application types
   - Develop a web-based playground

3. **Specialized Tutorials**
   - Create tutorials for extension development
   - Add tutorials for integration with other frameworks

4. **Package Publication**
   - Finalize package structure for PyPI
   - Create contribution guidelines
   - Implement release automation

A detailed plan for these remaining tasks is available in the [PHASE5_FINAL_STEPS.md](PHASE5_FINAL_STEPS.md) document.

## Timeline

Based on the current progress and remaining tasks, we estimate:

- Documentation Completion: 1 week
- Package Preparation: 1 week
- Quality Assurance and Release: 1 week

## Conclusion

Phase 5 has made significant progress in creating comprehensive documentation, examples, and tutorials for the Prompt Decorators framework. The work completed so far provides a solid foundation for users to understand and utilize the framework effectively. With the completion of the remaining tasks outlined in the final steps document, the framework will be ready for public release.

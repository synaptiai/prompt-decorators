- **Security Audit**: Conduct a comprehensive security review

## Advanced Features

- **Decorator Marketplace**: Create a central repository for sharing community-created decorators
- **Visual Decorator Builder**: Develop a GUI tool for creating and configuring decorators
- **Adaptive Decorators**: Implement decorators that adapt based on the prompt content or context
- **Multilingual Support**: Enhance decorators to work effectively with multiple languages
- **Versioned Registry**: Support multiple versions of decorators in the registry

## Integration and Ecosystem

- **LangChain Integration**: Develop deeper integration with the LangChain ecosystem
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Create specialized adapters for Hugging Face models
- **Web Framework Plugins**: Build plugins for popular web frameworks (Flask, FastAPI, Django)
- **Vector Database Connectors**: Add support for retrieving decorators from vector databases
- **Prompt Management System**: Develop a system for managing and versioning decorated prompts

## Analytics and Monitoring

- **Decorator Analytics**: Add tools for tracking decorator usage and effectiveness
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for decorator application time and token usage
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Create tools for comparing different decorator combinations
- **Quality Metrics**: Develop metrics for evaluating the quality of decorated prompts

## Advanced AI Capabilities

- **Auto-Decorator Selection**: Use AI to automatically select optimal decorators for a given prompt
- **Self-Optimizing Decorators**: Implement decorators that learn and improve based on usage patterns
- **Context-Aware Decorators**: Develop decorators that adapt based on conversation history
- **Multimodal Decorators**: Extend the framework to support multimodal prompts (text + images)
- **Decorator Synthesis**: Generate new decorators based on natural language descriptions

## Enterprise Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Add permissions for decorator creation and usage
- **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for compliance and security
- **Enterprise Deployment Tools**: Create tools for deploying in enterprise environments
- **High Availability**: Ensure the framework can operate in high-availability environments
- **SLA Monitoring**: Add tools for monitoring service level agreements

## Research and Innovation

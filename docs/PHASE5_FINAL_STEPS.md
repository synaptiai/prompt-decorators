### 2. Additional Examples
- [ ] Create examples for OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers
- [ ] Implement examples for web applications, CLI tools, and other application types
- [ ] Add more interactive examples with complete walkthroughs
- [ ] Create a simple web-based playground for decorator experimentation

### 3. Specialized Tutorials
- [ ] Develop tutorials for extension development
- [ ] Create tutorials for integrating with frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex
- [ ] Implement tutorials for performance optimization and benchmarking
- [ ] Add tutorials for security considerations when using LLMs

### 4. Domain-Specific Resources
- [ ] Expand domain-specific guides with more detailed examples
- [ ] Create specific guides for different LLM providers
- [ ] Implement guides for popular programming frameworks
- [ ] Add case studies of real-world implementations

## Package Publication Tasks

### 1. Finalize Package Structure
- [ ] Review and refine the current package structure
- [ ] Create a complete `setup.py` with proper dependencies
- [ ] Generate a `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
- [ ] Define package metadata and version information

### 2. Prepare for PyPI Publication
- [ ] Create a PyPI account and configure credentials
- [ ] Generate distribution packages (sdist and wheel)
- [ ] Test installation from local packages
- [ ] Draft PyPI package description and metadata

### 3. Documentation and Guidelines
- [ ] Finalize project README with comprehensive information
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed guidelines
- [ ] Develop a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file
- [ ] Implement issue and pull request templates

### 4. Create Release Automation
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- [ ] Implement automatic version bumping
- [ ] Create release note generation script
- [ ] Implement automated PyPI publishing

## Quality Assurance Tasks

### 1. Final Testing
- [ ] Verify all documentation links work correctly
- [ ] Test all examples to ensure they run as expected
- [ ] Verify installation from PyPI (test server)
- [ ] Run all automated tests with multiple Python versions

### 2. Community Feedback
- [ ] Share with a small group of beta testers
- [ ] Collect and address feedback on documentation
- [ ] Refine examples based on user experience
- [ ] Adjust tutorials based on comprehension feedback

## Detailed Timeline

### Week 1: Documentation Completion
- Days 1-2: Finalize documentation navigation and cross-referencing
- Days 3-4: Complete remaining tutorials and examples
- Days 5-7: Create domain-specific guides and specialized resources

### Week 2: Package Preparation
- Days 1-2: Finalize package structure and setup files
- Days 3-4: Prepare PyPI publication materials
- Days 5-7: Create contribution guidelines and project documentation

### Week 3: Quality Assurance and Release
- Days 1-3: Implement release automation and CI/CD
- Days 4-5: Conduct final testing and collect feedback
- Days 6-7: Address issues and prepare for final release

## Success Criteria

Phase 5 will be considered complete when:

1. All documentation is complete, navigable, and free of errors
2. Examples cover a wide range of use cases and LLM providers
3. Tutorials provide clear guidance for common tasks and extensions
4. Package structure is finalized and tested for distribution
5. Publication automation is implemented and tested
6. Contribution guidelines are established

## Conclusion

With these final steps completed, the Prompt Decorators framework will be fully documented, thoroughly tested, and ready for public release. The comprehensive documentation and examples created during Phase 5 will ensure that users can quickly adopt and extend the framework for their specific needs.

# AI Safety Guide: Using Prompt Decorators for Safer AI Interactions

This guide demonstrates how prompt decorators can be used to enhance the safety of interactions with large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems. By applying specific decorators and decorator chains, researchers and developers can implement guardrails, detect problematic inputs, and ensure more responsible outputs.

## Introduction

AI safety is a critical consideration when deploying language models in production environments. Prompt decorators provide a systematic approach to enhancing AI safety by:

1. Standardizing safety measures across applications
2. Providing reusable safety components
3. Enabling modular safety implementations that can be updated as safety research advances
4. Creating transparent, auditable safety protocols

## Safety-Enhancing Decorators

The Prompt Decorators framework includes several decorators specifically designed for safety:

### `ContentFilter` Decorator

This decorator helps filter potentially harmful or inappropriate content:

```python
from prompt_decorators import ContentFilter

# Create a content filter that screens for specific categories
safety_filter = ContentFilter(
    categories=["profanity", "hate_speech", "violence", "self_harm"],
    threshold=0.7,
    action="block"  # Alternatives: "warn", "flag"
)

# Apply to your prompt
safe_prompt = safety_filter("Tell me about combat techniques")

# The decorator will assess the prompt and take action based on the configuration
```

### `Boundary` Decorator

Establishes firm boundaries for what topics can be discussed:

```python
from prompt_decorators import Boundary

# Create boundaries for conversation
boundaries = Boundary(
    disallowed_topics=["illegal activities", "harmful instructions"],
    allowed_domains=["education", "science", "arts"],
    enforcement_level="strict"  # Alternatives: "moderate", "advisory"
)

# Apply to your prompt
bounded_prompt = boundaries("Let's discuss the chemistry of everyday substances")
```

### `Alignment` Decorator

Ensures outputs align with specified values:

```python
from prompt_decorators import Alignment

# Define values to align with
alignment_values = Alignment(
    values=["accuracy", "fairness", "helpfulness", "harmlessness"],
    emphasis="harmlessness"  # Prioritize this value when trade-offs exist
)

# Apply to your prompt
aligned_prompt = alignment_values("Explain the pros and cons of this technology")
```

## Implementing Input Validation

Input validation is a crucial safety measure. Here's how to implement it with decorators:

```python
from prompt_decorators import Validator, Chain

# Create a validator for user inputs
input_validator = Validator(
    max_length=1000,
    disallowed_patterns=[r"hack\s+into", r"bypass\s+security"],
    required_context=["question", "purpose"],
    sensitivity_check=True
)

# Combine with other decorators
safety_chain = Chain([
    input_validator,
    ContentFilter(categories=["malicious_instructions"]),
    Boundary(enforcement_level="strict")
])

# Apply to user input
processed_input = safety_chain(user_input)
```

## Output Filtering

Ensuring AI outputs are safe is equally important:

```python
from prompt_decorators import OutputFilter, Sanitizer

# Create an output filter
output_safety = OutputFilter(
    max_tokens=500,
    prohibited_content=["personal data", "exact instructions for harmful acts"],
    sensitivity_level="high"
)

# Apply sanitization
sanitizer = Sanitizer(
    remove_urls=True,
    anonymize_identifiers=True,
    replace_profanity=True
)

# Process the AI's response
final_output = sanitizer(output_safety(ai_response))
```

## Context-Aware Safety

Safety measures can be context-dependent:

```python
from prompt_decorators import ContextAware, ContentFilter

# Create a context-aware safety system
context_safety = ContextAware(
    domain="healthcare",
    audience="general_public",
    purpose="educational",
    safety_level="high"
)

# Different filters for different contexts
if context == "research":
    safety_filter = ContentFilter(categories=["pii"], threshold=0.9)
elif context == "public_forum":
    safety_filter = ContentFilter(
        categories=["profanity", "hate_speech", "pii"], 
        threshold=0.5
    )

# Apply appropriate safety measures
safe_prompt = safety_filter(context_safety(original_prompt))
```

## Monitoring and Logging

Tracking safety incidents and maintaining audit trails:

```python
from prompt_decorators import Logger, Telemetry

# Set up safety logging
safety_logger = Logger(
    log_level="warning",
    include_metadata=True,
    store_original_inputs=False  # For privacy
)

# Add telemetry for safety monitoring
safety_telemetry = Telemetry(
    events=["safety_filter_triggered", "boundary_violation", "input_rejected"],
    anonymous=True,
    compliance_mode="gdpr"
)

# Apply to your prompt processing pipeline
def process_prompt(prompt):
    decorated_prompt = safety_chain(prompt)
    safety_logger(decorated_prompt)  # Log the interaction
    safety_telemetry.record("prompt_processed")  # Record the event
    return decorated_prompt
```

## Research Applications

For AI safety researchers, prompt decorators offer powerful tools:

### Red Teaming

```python
from prompt_decorators import RedTeam, Logger

# Create a red teaming decorator
red_team = RedTeam(
    attack_types=["prompt_injection", "jailbreaking", "data_extraction"],
    automatic_variants=5,
    log_responses=True
)

# Apply to test model robustness
test_results = red_team("Tell me about yourself")

# Analyze the results
for variant, response in test_results.items():
    print(f"Attack variant: {variant}")
    print(f"Model response: {response}")
    print(f"Successful exploit: {test_results.is_successful(variant)}")
```

### Safety Benchmarking

```python
from prompt_decorators import Benchmark, Suite

# Create a safety benchmark
safety_benchmark = Benchmark(
    name="harm_prevention",
    categories=["refusal", "harmless_alternative", "warning_generation"],
    metrics=["success_rate", "robustness", "consistency"]
)

# Create a test suite
test_suite = Suite(
    benchmarks=[safety_benchmark],
    variants_per_prompt=3,
    record_full_trace=True
)

# Run the benchmark
results = test_suite.run(model="your_model", prompt_set="safety_prompts")
```

## Best Practices

For optimal AI safety when using prompt decorators:

1. **Layer your defenses**: Use multiple decorators in chains to provide defense in depth
2. **Update regularly**: Keep your safety decorators updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered
3. **Test thoroughly**: Regularly test your safety measures with red-teaming exercises
4. **Monitor continuously**: Implement logging and telemetry to detect safety failures
5. **Balance safety and utility**: Too strict safety measures may harm functionality; find the right balance
6. **Domain-specific measures**: Different applications require different safety approaches
7. **Transparent policies**: Make your safety measures visible to users where appropriate
8. **Feedback loops**: Create mechanisms for users to report safety failures
9. **Continuous improvement**: Regularly review and improve your safety decorators

By following this guide, AI safety researchers and developers can leverage prompt decorators to build more robust, safe, and responsible AI systems.

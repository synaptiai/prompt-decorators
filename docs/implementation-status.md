# Prompt Decorators Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of features described in the [Prompt Decorators Specification](prompt-decorators-specification-v1.0.md).

## Implementation Phases

The specification outlines a phased implementation approach. Current progress:

- **Phase 1 (Core Support)**: âœ… Complete
  - Core decorators are implemented
  - Basic transformation functionality works
  - Parameter validation is operational

- **Phase 2 (Extended Support)**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
  - Reasoning Process Decorators: âœ… Complete
  - Output Structure Decorators: âœ… Complete
  - Tone and Style Decorators: âœ… Complete
  - Verification and Quality Decorators: âœ… Complete
  - Meta-Decorators: ðŸ”„ Partially Complete

- **Phase 3 (Full Support)**: ðŸ•’ Planned
  - Complete implementation of all standard decorators
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Enhanced composition strategies

- **Phase 4 (Extensions)**: ðŸ•’ Planned
  - Extension loading mechanism
  - Domain-specific extensions
  - Extension discovery service

## Validation Tools

The specification mentions several validation tools. Their implementation status:

| Tool | Status | Current Implementation |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Decorator Validator | ðŸ”„ Partial | Basic validation in `scripts/validate_decorators.py` |
| Behavior Test Framework | ðŸ”„ Partial | Some behavior tests in `tests/` directory |
| Compatibility Scanner | ðŸ•’ Planned | Pending implementation |

## Test Suite

The specification references a dedicated test suite repository. Current status:

- **Dedicated Repository**: ðŸ•’ Planned
- **Current Tests**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
  - Located in the `tests/` directory of the main repository
  - Includes test cases for core decorators
  - Includes basic composition tests
  - Missing comprehensive error handling tests
  - Missing performance benchmarks

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Phase 2 components
2. âœ… Implement a unified validation CLI tool (completed in `scripts/prompt_validator.py`)
3. Expand test coverage
4. âœ… Document extension capabilities clearly (completed in `docs/extensions.md`)
5. Begin work on Extension Mechanism for Phase 4

## Compatibility Notes

Currently, the implementation fully supports:
- Python 3.8+
- All major operating systems
- All LLM providers via the standardized API

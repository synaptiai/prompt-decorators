# Prompt Decorators Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of features described in the [Prompt Decorators Specification](prompt-decorators-specification-v1.0.md).

## Implementation Phases

The specification outlines a phased implementation approach. Current progress:

- **Phase 1 (Core Support)**: âœ… Complete
  - Core decorators are implemented
  - Basic transformation functionality works
  - Parameter validation is operational

- **Phase 2 (Extended Support)**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
  - Reasoning Process Decorators: âœ… Complete
  - Output Structure Decorators: âœ… Complete
  - Tone and Style Decorators: âœ… Complete
  - Verification and Quality Decorators: âœ… Complete
  - Meta-Decorators: ðŸ”„ Partially Complete

- **Phase 3 (Full Support)**: ðŸ•’ Planned
  - Complete implementation of all standard decorators
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Enhanced composition strategies

- **Phase 4 (Extensions)**: ðŸ•’ Planned
  - Extension loading mechanism
  - Domain-specific extensions
  - Extension discovery service

## Feature Implementation Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Core Decorator Syntax | âœ… Complete | The core `+++Decorator(params)` syntax is fully implemented |
| Parameter Types | âœ… Complete | All parameter types (string, number, boolean, enum, array) are supported |
| Decorator Placement | âœ… Complete | Decorators can be placed at the beginning or on new lines |
| Versioning Syntax | ðŸ”„ Partial | Basic versioning works but version ranges aren't fully implemented |
| Error Handling | âœ… Complete | Implementations ignore syntax errors and proceed with processing |
| JSON Schema Definitions | âœ… Complete | All schemas are defined and used for validation |
| Core Decorators | âœ… Complete | All core decorators are implemented |
| Reasoning Process Decorators | âœ… Complete | All reasoning decorators are implemented |
| Output Structure Decorators | âœ… Complete | All output structure decorators are implemented |
| Decorator Conflicts/Compatibility | ðŸ”„ Partial | Basic conflict resolution works but compatibility checking is limited |
| Tone and Style Decorators | âœ… Complete | All tone and style decorators are implemented |
| Verification and Quality Decorators | âœ… Complete | All verification decorators are implemented |
| Meta-Decorators | ðŸ”„ Partial | Basic meta-decorators work but some advanced features are pending |
| Registry and Discovery | ðŸ”„ Partial | Registry structure exists but discovery service is pending |
| Extension Mechanism | ðŸ•’ Planned | Extension loading from URLs is planned for future releases |
| Standardization Process | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Specification is defined but feedback integration is ongoing |
| Security Considerations | ðŸ”„ Partial | Basic input validation is implemented |
| Testing and Validation | ðŸ”„ Partial | Unit tests exist but comprehensive test suite is in development |

## Validation Tools

The specification mentions several validation tools. Their implementation status:

| Tool | Status | Current Implementation |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Decorator Validator | ðŸ”„ Partial | Basic validation in `scripts/validate_decorators.py` |
| Behavior Test Framework | ðŸ”„ Partial | Some behavior tests in `tests/` directory |
| Compatibility Scanner | ðŸ•’ Planned | Pending implementation |

## Test Suite

The specification references a dedicated test suite repository. Current status:

- **Dedicated Repository**: ðŸ•’ Planned
- **Current Tests**: ðŸ”„ In Progress
  - Located in the `tests/` directory of the main repository
  - Includes test cases for core decorators
  - Includes basic composition tests
  - Missing comprehensive error handling tests
  - Missing performance benchmarks

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Phase 2 components
2. Implement a unified validation CLI tool
3. Expand test coverage
4. Document extension capabilities clearly
5. Begin work on Extension Mechanism for Phase 4

## Compatibility Notes

Currently, the implementation fully supports:
- Python 3.8+
- All major operating systems
- All LLM providers via the standardized API

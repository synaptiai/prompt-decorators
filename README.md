## üîç Overview

Prompt Decorators is a powerful and flexible framework that enables systematic modification of prompts to achieve specific behaviors in LLM responses. Based on the [Prompt Decorators Specification](docs/prompt-decorators-specification-v1.0.md), it provides a structured way to define, combine, and apply decorators to prompts.

### Background & Motivation

As Large Language Models become increasingly integrated into workflows across industries, the need for standardized, consistent ways to interact with these systems has become apparent. Current prompt engineering approaches are largely ad-hoc, requiring extensive documentation, reinvention, and significant cognitive overhead when switching between systems or use cases.

Prompt Decorators address this challenge by providing a systematic approach to modifying AI behavior through simple, composable annotations. Inspired by the Decorator pattern in programming and Python's function decorators, they serve as a layer of abstraction that decouples the core prompt from instructions about how to process and present the response.

### Challenges in Prompt Engineering

Current prompt engineering suffers from several limitations:

- **Inconsistency**: Instructions vary widely between users, platforms, and models
- **Verbosity**: Detailed instructions consume token context that could be used for content
- **Cognitive Overhead**: Users must remember or document specific prompting techniques
- **Lack of Composability**: Combining different instruction paradigms is cumbersome
- **Undocumented Behavior**: Expected model behavior is often implicit rather than explicit

### Benefits of Prompt Decorators

The Prompt Decorators framework addresses these challenges through:

- **Standardization**: Common vocabulary and syntax across platforms and models
- **Efficiency**: Concise annotations that reduce token consumption
- **Reusability**: Consistent behaviors that can be reused across different contexts
- **Composability**: Ability to combine decorators for complex interaction patterns
- **Explicit Behavior**: Clear documentation of expected model responses
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Simple annotations instead of lengthy instructions

### Key Features

- **üìö Registry-based decorator management**: Centralized registry of decorators with metadata
- **‚úÖ Parameter validation and type checking**: Robust validation of decorator parameters
- **üî¢ Decorator versioning**: Support for semantic versioning of decorators

- **üìù Documentation generation**: Automatic generation of documentation for decorators
- **üß© Dynamic loading**: Runtime decorator loading from definition files
- **üîç Runtime decorator discovery**: Dynamic discovery and registration of decorators

## üìä Implementation Status

The Prompt Decorators project is currently in active development.

For a detailed breakdown of implementation status, see our [Implementation Status](docs/implementation-status.md) document.

### üöß Roadmap

The roadmap for this project is outlined in the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

You can install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install prompt-decorators
```

For additional functionality, you can install optional dependencies:

```bash
# For Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
pip install "prompt-decorators[mcp]"

# For development and testing
pip install "prompt-decorators[dev,test]"

# For documentation
pip install "prompt-decorators[docs]"

# For all optional dependencies
pip install "prompt-decorators[all]"
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import prompt_decorators as pd

# Load available decorators
pd.load_decorator_definitions()

# Create a decorator instance
reasoning = pd.create_decorator_instance("Reasoning", depth="comprehensive")

# Apply the decorator to a prompt
prompt = "Explain the concept of prompt engineering."
decorated_prompt = reasoning.apply(prompt)

print(decorated_prompt)
```

# Minimal Core Decorators

These five decorators form the minimal conforming implementation and **MUST** be supported by any implementation claiming compliance with the Prompt Decorators standard.

## Decorators in this category:

1. **Reasoning** - Explicit reasoning path before conclusion
2. **StepByStep** - Sequential problem-solving with labeled steps
3. **OutputFormat** - Specify output format
4. **Tone** - Overall tone adjustment
5. **Version** - Specify standard version compatibility

According to the specification (Section 1.3 Conformance), implementations claiming conformance to this standard MUST implement at least these five decorators.
